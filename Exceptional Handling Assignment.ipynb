    "### An exception is an abnormal event that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions are usually caused by runtime errors, such as dividing by zero, trying to access an element in an array with an out-of-bounds index, or trying to access a file that does not exist. Exceptions are not syntax errors, but they can still prevent the program from running if they are not handled properly.\n",
    "### A syntax error occurs when the structure of a program does not conform to the rules of the programming language. Syntax errors are usually detected by the compiler or interpreter when the program is being compiled or executed, and they prevent the program from running. Syntax errors are usually caused by mistakes in the source code, such as typos, omissions, or incorrect use of syntax.\n",

    "### 5. Custom or User-defined Exceptions are designed as per the requirement of the program. Using custom Exception we can have our own Exception and a meaningful message explaining the cause of the exception. We can create an exception by extending the Exception or RuntimeException class in our own Exception class.Custom exceptions are helpful in many situations. They allow you to define your own error conditions and handle them in a more specific and meaningful way. For example, letâ€™s say you are writing a program that reads data from a file. If the file is not found, Python will raise a FileNotFoundError. However, this exception may not provide enough information to the user about what went wrong. In this case, you can define your own custom exception, such as FileNotFoundCustomError, which can provide more specific details about the error. "
