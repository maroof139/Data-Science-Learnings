    "### Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently. In a simple, single-core CPU, it is achieved using frequent switching between threads. This is termed context switching. In context switching, the state of a thread is saved and the state of another thread is loaded whenever any interrupt (due to I/O or manually set) takes place. Context switching takes place so frequently that all the threads appear to be running parallelly (this is termed multitasking).\n",
