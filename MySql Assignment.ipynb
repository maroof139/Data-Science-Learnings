    "### A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. In almost all situations SQL databases are vertically scalable. This means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU, or SSD. But on the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database. It is similar to adding more floors to the same building versus adding more buildings to the neighborhood. Thus NoSQL can ultimately become larger and more powerful, making these databases the preferred choice for large or ever-changing data sets.\n",
    "### SQL databases are table-based on the other hand NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases, or wide-column stores. This makes relational SQL databases a better option for applications that require multi-row transactions such as an accounting system or for legacy systems that were built for a relational structure. \n",
    "### SQL and a relational database make it easy to handle a great deal of information, scale as necessary and allow flexible access to data only needing to update data once instead of changing multiple files, for instance. It’s also best for assessing data integrity. Since each piece of information is stored in a single place, there’s no problem with former versions confusing the picture.\n",
    "### While NoSQL is good when the availability of big data is more crucial, SQL is valued for ensuring data validity. It’s also a wise decision when a business needs to expand in response to shifting customer demands. NoSQL offers high performance, flexibility, and ease of use."

    "### Primary Key - A primary key is a special attribute or field within a database table that uniquely identifies each record or row in that table. It acts as a distinctive label for every information stored in the table, ensuring that no two records have the same identifier. This unique identification helps locate, access, and manipulate specific data within the table. Primary keys are used for a variety of purposes, including maintaining data integrity and integrity constraints, ensuring efficient record lookup, forming relationships between different tables in a database, and providing an effective way to ensure the uniqueness of records\n",
    "### Foreign Key - A foreign key is a relational database theory that connects and establishes relationships among different tables by referring to the primary key of another table. This linking enables sharing and exchanging data between the two tables. The purpose of using foreign keys is to enforce referential integrity and maintain data consistency across tables. It ensures that the values stored in the foreign key field of one table are also present in the primary key field of another table. A foreign key is usually composed of multiple columns used to identify a row in the related table uniquely. The number of columns used depends on how many columns make up the primary key in the related table. "
